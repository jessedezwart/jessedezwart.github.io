            <p>
                For my animation class I paired up with another student. At the time I was really enjoying working with Blender and she really liked drawing cute characters. We figured we'd try to combine the two things and try to animate a 2D drawn character in a 3D environment in Blender.

We chose the song Girl in Blue by Animal sun because we both really enjoyed it and envisioned the scene right away. We built a storyboard, she started drawing and I started building the world.

The biggest challenge we faced was first getting the drawn character into Blender. After we figured out how to it was a tough but very fun challenge to animate everything correctly and keyframe everything to the right second of the song!

Check out the whole animation on the right!
