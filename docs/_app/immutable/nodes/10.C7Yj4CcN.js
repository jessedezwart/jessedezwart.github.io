            Helps spread awareness of the importance of recycling batteries</p> <br> <h3>Tools Used: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop</h3></div> <section class="project-details"><h2>About the Project</h2> <p>The marketing team for the Dutch company for collecting and recycling batteries Stibat, asked for help creating a marketing campaign. Their new mission is to increase the amount of recycled batteries from 45% to 65%. To do this they wanted to reach a new target audience of young adults between the ages of 18 and 25.

The concept created was an instagram campaign that would easily be spread by saying "Double tap to recharge the world", since double tapping a post likes it and therefore spreads it.​

After this the instagram account would have multiple shocking posts to grab the attention, informative posts of what can be done with recycled batteries and activating posts, intending to make the reader go out and bring their batteries to the proper locations.​

Stibat chose our campaign as winner and invited us to go over for a peek into their work. They also told us they would probably use aspects of our campaign for their official campaign, but unfortunately I haven't seen anything as of yet.</p></section> <div class="video-container"><iframe title="Girl in Blue animation" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xn0H4Y5__lk?si=6XR6kEVJlJ3Zxx_9" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>`);function s(e){var t=i();o(e,t)}export{s as component};
